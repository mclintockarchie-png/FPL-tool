Goal: To build a prediction model that can help with my fantasy football Premier League team. 

Important context:

- I have a Claude pro plan subscription and i want to limit my token usage so i can code for longer. 
- break the code into segements and only deal with the relevant segment when i ask for a modification
- Do not perfomr token intensive actions without asking unless absolutely necessary. 
- Throughout the code, leave comments so that i can understand what is going on in each distinctive section.
- This is a learning project for me an also a practical project. 

Steps:

- Learn the FPL (fantasy premier league) scoring rules and setup rules.
- Understand harvested data in full.
- Use harvested data combined with FPL Api to predict which players will score the most points in each gameweek.
- Make an XI that is predicted to score the highest total points each gameweek.
- Show me honourable mentions (players that narrowly missed out on the starting XI and their scores).
- Understand my team, budget, free transfers etc
- Recommend to me the best transfers each week to improve my total xP
- Win fantasy football leagues. 

Potential improvements to work on later (bare in mind)

- Can we make the model learn from the results each week - self-improvement machine learning model. 
- Can we integreate the different chips to the model (triple captain etc)
